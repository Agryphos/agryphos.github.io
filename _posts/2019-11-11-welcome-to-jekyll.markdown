Here's the first blog post for the site. This website is built using jekyll as a static site generator engine. Jekyll blog post files must be named according to a specific format (that being 'Year-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP').

This is my second try at making this stuff about static site generators and css pre-processors work. Last time I couldn't wrap my head around the file structure of the site and what to change and how to change it. I am determined to make that work out better this time though.

This blog can also show neat code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Here we have some javascript
'use strict'
let a = 10
console.log(a)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
// Here we have some java
int a = 10;
System.out.println(a);
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on the back-end of all of this.
