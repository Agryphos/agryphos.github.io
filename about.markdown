Hello! My name is Jacob Skoog and I am the proprietor of this little web page.  
I am a software engineering student at Linnaeus University studying by remote from Jönköping. Other than studying I work as a personal care assistant.

### Interests
On my free time I like to watch movies and series with my wife, or play some video games if I'm on my own. When I was a teenager I decided to learn Japanese and even though I haven't made any real efforts to study for the past 3 years I still know enough to get by in a conversation. I enjoy listening to podcasts about various subjects. I have listened to podcasts about design, linguistics, board games, crime and more.  
I also like playing board games, but I haven't really found a gaming group or the time to sit down and play for a while now.

#### Favourite Video Games
Some of my favourite video games include Psychonauts and Knights of the Old Republic I&II. These games, especially KotOR, hold a special place among the games I've played. Other games that I've enjoyed a lot are Starcraft II, being the first RTS I really got into, right before League of Legends dragged me away. League of Legends was the first game I really played online over a voice chat. I have played a fair amount of CCG's, though currently I mostly engage with Magic the Gathering.

#### Favourite Board Games
I got into board games more seriously when I lived in Kristinehamn in Sweden a few years back. I made some good friends there that would regularly meet to play board games. I had played some serious hobby games before, but this was the first time I was exposed to a greater variety and with more regularity.  
My favourite games are "Race for the Galaxy", "Suburbia" and "Marvel Legendary" (though, for the love of board games, don't play it with more than 3 people).

### Why software development
So why did I start in software development? In school, my best subjects have always been maths, physics and others that heavily rely on maths. I enjoy the feeling of solving abstract problems, constructing a method to produce the solution, or output, that I want. I find that programming gives me a similar feeling of enjoyment. I like constructing these little parts of a program and putting them together to accomplish my goal. It's like I get to create a little abstract machine that does what I want, not entirely dissimilar to what I felt about maths.
